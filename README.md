### What is the difference between ros-helm and rosemacs?


delivered that way because it contains common LISP code used to interface emacs with
the ROS through LISP.

On the other hand `ros-helm` has a smaller set of features than `rosemacs`. You might
be better off using that package if you code ROS in LISP.
